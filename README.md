**Golden Arcane Lite** is a *Minecraft: Java* & *Bedrock Edition* datapack/add-on offering most of *Golden Arcane*'s key features, -- including spells, custom mobs and structures -- while also being compatible with both Java and Bedrock Editions for Minecraft.

As a rule of thumb, any feature from the original datapack which can be feasibly ported to Bedrock will appear here. **As such, this is in no way an optimization of the original pack,** but rather a curated selection of compatible features for other platforms.

## Features

* *Golden Arrow*, a boss-like entity with unique abilities and novelty loot.
  * Summon with `/function garrow:instance/spawn` (subject to change)
* A spell-casting system, with simple yet effective charms and magic for everyday use.
  * Currently has only two examples: `Weather: Clear/Rain/Thunder` and `Charm: Smelt`.
* Soon! :tm:

## Versioning

This project follows the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` model; The closer to the left a number is, the more impactful that version's changes are.

Whenever a new version is available, the following rule applies for updating existing saves:

* `PATCH` updates (`0.0.x`) are least likely to break existing saves, and may be downloaded safely.
* `MINOR` updates (`0.x.0`) *should* work in older saves, but may still introduce some changes which may alter how one plays the game; A backup is advised before updating your world's datapack.
* `MAJOR` updates (`x.0.0`) introduce breaking changes which are often incompatible with older saves. When updating to those, always have a backup your world beforehand, as corruption and data loss are possible and even likely to occur.

The datapack's current version is: `0.2.1` (Indev); Its target Minecraft version is `1.21.1` (Java) / `1.21.30` (Bedrock).

## Platform

**Golden Arcane Lite** is available as a Java datapack and/or a Bedrock Edition add-on. For the original, legacy add-on for Bedrock, see [here](https://github.com/Ayden-Foxx/TheGoldenArcane-BE).
