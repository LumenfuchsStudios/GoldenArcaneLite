# ![Golden Arcane - A world of magic within](/goldark_title_logo.png)

> This is a Java Edition port of the original *Minecraft: Bedrock Edition* addon "The Golden Arcane".  
> As with the original, many features are yet to be added, while others are still being ported to the Java version as well.

**Golden Arcane** is a *Minecraft: Java Edition* datapack focusing on simple yet useful mechanics around a same material: gold.  
By drawing obscure magics from this often overlooked metal, players (and at times, even the world itself) may obtain abilities not otherwise attainable before -- or more often than not, find new ways to the same old.

Despite that, though, many other mundane materials may also serve on one's magical journey; Flowers, ores and gems, food and even ordinary blocks may be of relevance to a keen-eyed practicioner. Most "spells" are made with simplicity and ease of use in mind, offering an easy integration with vanilla gameplay.

While working fine on its own, this pack is generally designed with the idea of being a secondary magic path, rather than the only one. As such, overpowered mass-destruction spells are *mostly* not present here; For these, a larger magic mod would be better suited instead.

## Features

* [DEVEL] *Golden Arrow*, a boss-like entity with unique abilities and novelty loot.
  * Summon with `/function garrow:instance/spawn` (subject to change)
* [DEVEL] Spells! Currently only with two examples ("Weather: Clear/Rain/Thunder" and "Smelt")
* Soon!

## Versioning

This project follows the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` model; The closer to the left a number is, the more impactful that version's changes are.

Whenever a new version is available, the following rule applies for updating existing saves:

* `PATCH` updates (`0.0.x`) are least likely to break existing saves, and may be downloaded safely.
* `MINOR` updates (`0.x.0`) *should* work in older saves, but may still introduce some changes which may alter how one plays the game; A backup is advised before updating your world's datapack.
* `MAJOR` updates (`x.0.0`) introduce breaking changes which are often incompatible with older saves. When updating to those, always have a backup your world beforehand, as corruption and data loss are possible and even likely to occur.

The datapack's current version is: `0.2.1` (indev); Its target Minecraft version is `1.21.1`.

## Platform

**Golden Arcane** is the datapack for *Minecraft: Java Edition*. For the (legacy) *Bedrock Edition* addon, see [here](https://github.com/Ayden-Foxx/TheGoldenArcane-BE).
