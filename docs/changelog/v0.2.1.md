# Version 0.2.1 - Hotfix: Spell-casting [Indev]

0.2.1 is a minor patch to Golden Arcane's spell-casting system.

## Contents

* Fixed a bug where casting any spell would run the user's held item's effects incessantly.
* Casting a spell now properly triggers a 100-tick cooldown.
    * The cooldown is triggered by `goldark:spells/failsafe`, and updated then reset by `goldark:spells/main`.
* Increased spells' casting duration from 0.1 seconds to 1 second to avoid spam issues.
* Tweaked particles from casting `Weather` spells.
